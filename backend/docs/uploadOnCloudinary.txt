working:
    upload public url
    get file instance by its filename
    see if the current user is owner of the file then:
        provide him the file
    else:
        see if he is their in one of his sharedWith Array then:
            share
        else:
            don't share
file render approach:
    when a user asks for the file through filename i check
        1. he is logged in
        2.i see if he is the owner of the file or one in the sharedWith
        3.instead of providing authorized cloudinary url i download the file in the repo ./public/temp
            and show him the local Machine downlaoded server file instead of cloud file that too with 
            an expiration time after that the file gets deleted from the local Machine.
